# ComfyUI prompt control

Nodes for LoRA and prompt scheduling that make basic operations in ComfyUI completely prompt-controllable.

LoRA and prompt scheduling should produce identical output to the equivalent ComfyUI workflow using multiple samplers or the various conditioning manipulation nodes. If you find situations where this is not the case, please report a bug.

## Note about stability

The nodes are currently undergoing some refactoring and rewriting.

Interfaces for nodes marked "v2" are subject to breaking change at any time, though at worst you'll likely just have to recreate a few nodes.

Nodes marked "experimental" are very likely to change or disappear completely, or might not even work completely.

## What can it do?

Things you can control via the prompt:
- Weight interpretation types (comfy, A1111, etc.)
- Prompt editing and filtering without multiple samplers
- LoRA loading and scheduling via ComfyUI's hook system
- Masking, compositions and area control, combining prompts (`AND`), `BREAK`
- Prompt masking with cutoff
- SDXL parameters

If you find prompt scheduling inconvenient, `PCEncodePrompt` can be used as a drop-in replacement for `CLIPTextEncode` to get everything else.

[This example workflow](workflows/example.json?raw=1) implements a two-pass workflow illustrating most scheduling features.

The tools in this repository combine well with the macro and wildcard functionality in [comfyui-utility-nodes](https://github.com/asagi4/comfyui-utility-nodes)

## Requirements

For `PCEncodeSchedule` and `PCLoraHooksFromSchedule`, you'll need at least version 0.3.7 of ComfyUI (0.3.36 of ComfyUI desktop).

You need to have `lark` installed in your Python environment for parsing to work (If you reuse A1111's venv, it'll already be there).

If you use the portable version of ComfyUI on Windows with its embedded Python, you must open a terminal in the ComfyUI installation directory and run the command:
```
.\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install lark
```

Then restart ComfyUI afterwards.

## Notable changes

I try to avoid behavioural changes that break old prompts, but they may happen occasionally.

- 2024-12-03 ComfyUI merged support for model/conditioning hooks. There are two new nodes, `PCEncodeSchedule` and `PCLoraHooksFromSchedule` that can be used in combination with the hook nodes. Some functionality is still missing from them, but going forward, these nodes will be the only nodes supported; **I will not spend significant time fixing bugs in the old monkeypatched nodes anymore.**

## Note on how schedules work

ComfyUI does not use the step number to determine whether to apply conds; instead, it uses the sampler's timestep value which is affected by the scheduler you're using. This means that when the sampler scheduler isn't linear, the schedules generated by prompt control will not be either.

# Features
## Scheduling and LoRA loading

See the [syntax documentation](doc/syntax.md)

## Advanced CLIP encoding

If you use `PCEncodeSchedule` or `PCEncodePrompt`. advanced encodings are available automatically. Thanks to BlenderNeko for the original code.

You can use the syntax `STYLE(weight_interpretation, normalization)` in a prompt to affect how prompts are interpreted.

The weight interpretations available are:
  - comfy (default)
  - comfy++
  - compel
  - down_weight
  - A1111
  - perp

Normalizations are:
  - none (default)
  - length
  - mean

The normalization calculations are independent operations and you can combine them with `+`, eg `STYLE(A1111, length+mean)` or `STYLE(comfy, mean+length)`, or even something silly like `STYLE(perp, mean+length+mean+length)`

For the legacy nodes, you need to have [Advanced CLIP Encoding nodes](https://github.com/BlenderNeko/ComfyUI_ADV_CLIP_emb/tree/master) cloned into your `custom_nodes` for more options will be available.

The style can be specified separately for each AND:ed prompt, but the first prompt is special; later prompts will "inherit" it as default. For example:

```
STYLE(A1111) a (red:1.1) cat with (brown:0.9) spots and a long tail AND an (old:0.5) dog AND a (green:1.4) (balloon:1.1)
```
will interpret everything as A1111, but
```
a (red:1.1) cat with (brown:0.9) spots and a long tail AND STYLE(A1111) an (old:0.5) dog AND a (green:1.4) (balloon:1.1)
```
Will interpret the first one using the default ComfyUI behaviour, the second prompt with A1111 and the last prompt with the default again

For things (ie. the code imports) to work, the nodes must be cloned in a directory named exactly `ComfyUI_ADV_CLIP_emb`.

## Cutoff

`PCEncodeSchedule` reimplements cutoff from [ComfyUI Cutoff](https://github.com/BlenderNeko/ComfyUI_Cutoff). You do not need to have the nodes installed.

The syntax is
```
a group of animals, [CUT:white cat:white], [CUT:brown dog:brown:0.5:1.0:1.0:_]
```
You should read the prompt as `a group of animals, white cat, brown dog`, but CUT causes the tokens in `target_tokens` to be masked off from the base prompt in `region_text`, so that their effect can be isolated, and you're less likely to get brown cats or white dogs.

Target tokens are treated individually, separated by space, for example, `[CUT:green apple, red apple, green leaf:green apple]` will mask *both* greens and the apple, giving you `+ +, red +, + leaf`. To mask out just `green apple`, use `[CUT:green apple, red apple:green_apple]` which will result in a masked prompt of `+ +, red apple`. Escape `_` with a `\`.

the parameters in the `CUT` section are `region_text:target_tokens:weight;strict_mask:start_from_masked:padding_token` of which only the first two are required. The default values are `weight=1.0`, `strict_mask=1.0` `start_from_masked=1.0`, `padding_token=+`

If `strict_mask`, `start_from_masked` or `padding_token` are specified in more than one CUT, the *last* one becomes the default for any CUTs afterwards that do not explicitly set the parameters. For example, in:

`[CUT:white cat:white:0.5] and [CUT:black parrot, flying:black:1.0:0.5] and [CUT:green apple:green]`

`white cat` will a weight of 0.5, and 1.0 for all parameters, and `black parrot` and `green apple` will *both* have a `strict_mask` parameter of 0.5.

The parameters affect how the masked and unmasked prompts are combined to produce the final embedding. Just play around with them.

# Nodes

## PCLoraHooksFromSchedule

Creates a ComfyUI `HOOKS` object from a prompt schedule. Can be attached to a CLIP model to perform encoding and LoRA switching

The hooks can be a bit slow sometimes, especially in cases where the LoRA spec doesn't actually require reloading the patches every time you sample. Try `PCHooksFromScheduleWithOptimizationTest`. (Though that node is likely to go away eventually).

## PCEncodeSchedule

Encodes all prompts in a schedule. Pass in a `CLIP` object with hooks attached for LoRA scheduling, then use the resulting `CONDITIONING` normally

## PCEncodePrompt

Encodes a single prompt *without* scheduling or LoRA loading features (but including everything else).

Note: This does not currently ignore `<lora:...:1>` and will treat it as part of the prompt.

## PromptToSchedule
Parses a schedule from a text prompt. A schedule is essentially an array of `(valid_until, prompt)` pairs that the other nodes can use.

## FilterSchedule
Filters a schedule according to its parameters, removing any *changes* that do not occur within `[start, end)`.

The node also does tag filtering if any tags are specified.

Always returns at least the last prompt in the schedule if everything would otherwise be filtered.

`start=0, end=0` returns the prompt at the start and `start=1.0, end=1.0` returns the prompt at the end.

## PCScheduleSettings
Returns an object representing **default values** for the `SDXL` function and allows configuring `MASK_SIZE` outside the prompt. You need to apply them to a schedule with `PCApplySettings`. Note that for the SDXL settings to apply, you still need to have `SDXL()` in the prompt.

The "steps" parameter currently does nothing; it's for future features.

## PCApplySettings
Applies the give default values from `PCScheduleSettings` to a schedule

## PCPromptFromSchedule

Extracts a text prompt from a schedule; also logs it to the console.
LoRAs are *not* included in the text prompt, though they are logged.

## PCScheduleAddMasks

Add masks to a schedule object, for use with IMASK (see [syntax documentation](doc/syntax.md))

# Legacy nodes

See [here](doc/legacy.md)

# Known issues

- ComfyUI's LoRA hooks are a bit slower than LoRALoader currently when the LoRA doesn't actually require scheduling. Hopefully this will improve upstream.
