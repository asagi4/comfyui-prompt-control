## Masking

### MASK, IMASK and AREA

You can use `MASK(x1 x2, y1 y2, weight, op)` to specify a region mask for a prompt. The values are specified as a percentage with a float between `0` and `1`, or as absolute pixel values (these can't be mixed). `1` will be interpreted as a percentage instead of a pixel value.

Multiple `MASK` or `IMASK` calls will be composited together using ComfyUI's `MaskComposite` node, using `op` as the `operation` parameter (defaulting to `multiply`).

Similarly, you can use `AREA(x1 x2, y1 y2, weight)` to specify an area for the prompt (see ComfyUI's area composition examples). The area is calculated by ComfyUI relative to your latent size.

### Custom masks: IMASK and `PCAddMaskToCLIP`

You can attach custom masks to a `CLIP` with the `PC: Attach Mask` nodes and then refer to those masks in the prompt using `IMASK(index, weight, op)`. Indexing starts from zero, so 0 is the first attached mask etc. `PCSCheduleAddMasks` ignores empty inputs, so if you only add a mask to the `mask4` input, it will still have index 0.

Applying the nodes multiple times *appends* masks rather than overriding existing ones, so if you need more than 4, you can just use it more than once.

### Behaviour of masks
If multiple `MASK`s are specified, they are combined together with ComfyUI's `MaskComposite` node, with `op` specifying the operation to use (default `multiply`). In this case, the combined mask weight can be set with `MASKW(weight)` (defaults to 1.0).

Masks assume a size of `(512, 512)`, unless overridden with `PC: Configure PCTextEncode` and pixel values will be relative to that. ComfyUI will scale the mask to match the image resolution. You can change it manually by using `MASK_SIZE(width, height)` anywhere in the prompt,

These are handled per `AND`-ed prompt, so in `prompt1 AND MASK(...) prompt2`, the mask will only affect prompt2.

The default values are `MASK(0 1, 0 1, 1)` and you can omit unnecessary ones, that is, `MASK(0 0.5, 0.3)` is `MASK(0 0.5, 0.3 1, 1)`

Note that because the default values are percentages, `MASK(0 256, 64 512)` is valid, but `MASK(0 200)` will raise an error.

Masking does not affect LoRA scheduling unless you set unet weights to 0 for a LoRA.

### FEATHER: Mask operations

When you use `MASK` or `IMASK`, you can also call `FEATHER(left top right bottom)` to apply feathering using ComfyUI's `FeatherMask` node. The values are in pixels and default to `0`.

If multiple masks are used, `FEATHER` is applied *before compositing* in the order they appear in the prompt, and any leftovers are applied to the combined mask. If you want to skip feathering a mask while compositing, just use `FEATHER()` with no arguments.

For example:
```
MASK(1) MASK(2) MASK(3) FEATHER(1) FEATHER() FEATHER(3) weirdmask FEATHER(4)
```

gives you a mask that is a combination of 1, 2 and 3, where 1 and 3 are feathered before compositing and then `FEATHER(4)` is applied to the composite.

The order of the `FEATHER` and `MASK` calls doesn't matter; you can have `FEATHER` before `MASK` or even interleave them.
