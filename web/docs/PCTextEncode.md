# PC: Text Encode (no scheduling)

This node encodes text using some special syntax for advanced features. You should rarely need to use this node directly, and instead use `PC: Schedule Prompt` which uses this node under the hood.

For documentation on syntax, see the [documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/asagi4/comfyui-prompt-control/blob/master/doc/basic.md)
